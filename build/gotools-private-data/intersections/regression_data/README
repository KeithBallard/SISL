Test area for the regression tests.

Prior to running the tests the user must first compile the applications
involved in the test (on ../app).

Then enter the regression directory where the test scripts reside:
'cd regression'

2 regression scripts reside in this directory:
- run_reg: takes no argument and involves all apps.
	   Creates variuos files, among which 'REG.ALL' is the most
	   interesting.
- time_reg: takes the app-name as argument, performs operations only
	    if it involves the input app.
	    Creates variuos files, among which 'REG.TIME_<app_name>_machname'
	    (where machname='uname -n' is the machine name of the user) is the
	    most interesting.  Additionally 'REG.VER' and 'REG.ERR' are created
	    in the various '../defects/solved/int_dir_*'-directories.

After having run the script the user may want to commit the new test results to
the cvs repository:
./update_cvs_results
The above mentioned files are then added to the cvs tree. If this is the first
time the test is performed on a machine new entries will be added, otherwise
the entries replace previous versions of the files.
